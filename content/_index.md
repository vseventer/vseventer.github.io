Hi, Iâ€™m Mark. I am a full stack software engineer. After obtaining a degree in Computer Science, I worked with start-ups, as well as large enterprises, both on-site and remotely from three different continents.

I love writing software and am always on the lookout for new tools, technologies, and opportunities. My goal is to never stop learning, and contributing to open-source projects is one of the ways in which I achieve this. For example, see my travel blog, [MarkMyJourney.com](https://www.markmyjourney.com/).

Now, I'm looking for an exciting position with a startup in Boston or New York, starting September or October 2017. I need a work visa - I am eligible for cap-exempt H-1B visa.
