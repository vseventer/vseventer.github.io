Hi, I’m Mark. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with 10 Years of Experience.
<!--more-->

In my 10 Years of Experience, I helped develop Fashionchick.nl (acquired by Sanoma Media in 2013), before moving to the United States to work for start-up Kinvey (acquired by Progress in 2017). I continued doing so remotely from Australia, before joining Tesco, UK’s biggest supermarket chain, to launch the (mobile) website of Tesco Grocery. In my spare time, I maintain a number of projects, like my travel blog, [MarkMyJourney.com](https://www.markmyjourney.com/).

I'm looking for an exciting new opportunity, starting immediately. I love experimenting with the latest web technologies, improving accessibility and performance of applications, and working with passionate people.
