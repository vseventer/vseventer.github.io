## Travel

### Fly

#### Paris (CDG/ORY)
From the East Coast, flights into Paris are often quite affordable and will put you about four hours away from Chateau de Varennes.

You can always add a few days to your trip to enjoy everything the French capital has to offer.

#### Geneva (GVA)
Geneva, on the French-Swiss border, is about two-and-a-half hours away from the venue.

Make a stop along the way in Annecy, a quaint alpine town next to Lake Annecy. Or, if you're really adventurous, majestic Mont Blanc is within driving distance as well.

#### Lyon (LYS)
Only two hours away, Lyon is the closest airport to fly into.

The city is known as the Food Capital of France, so eat your hearts out! Lyon is also a great starting point for the French alps, or the Provence going south if you fancy that.
