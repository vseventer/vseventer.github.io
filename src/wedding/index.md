### Our Story

<img alt="Our Story" class="c-card__image" loading="lazy" src="~wedding/images/IMG_1391-square.JPG?format=jpg&name=wedding/our-story.[contenthash:8].jpg&size=142" width="144" height="144" />

Our love story began in Boston, back in 2014 when Herta and Mark met at a travel meet up. Flirtatious banter was exchanged, sparking a connection that’s still going strong.

A few months later, they set out on an around the world adventure. They are proud to have called Melbourne, London, and now New York home.

### The Proposal

Herta had always wanted to visit Lapland in winter, and little did she know Mark and Santa were on the same page this year. In the midst of the freezing, beautiful white snow and sparkling igloos,  Mark finally proposed. By some miracle Herta didn’t drop the ring in the snow and they happily returned to their hotel celebrating the proper way- with champagne, chocolate, and stinky cheese.

They can’t wait for this exciting new chapter to begin!
