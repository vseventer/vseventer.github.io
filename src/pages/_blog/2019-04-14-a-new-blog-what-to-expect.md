It has taken me a surprisingly long time to publish my first blog post. You’d say that, as an engineer, I’d be able to spin up a blogging platform in a matter of minutes. While that might be true, I am a perfectionist: I started at least ten blogs to only never finish a single one of them. Until today, that is. Welcome!
<!-- excerpt -->

## My story
Back up to 2012. I just graduated with a Masters degree in Computer Science and moved from **The Netherlands** across the Atlantic. In **Boston, MA**, I would start my career as a software engineer at a local start-up I interned with just six months prior, called [Kinvey][1]. From here, life has been a bit of a rollercoaster (the good kind):

* 2014: I decide to leave Boston and embark on a six-month backpacking trip through **Asia** and **South America**.
* 2015: You can only backpack for so long, and the trip comes to an end. The final flight (with a free upgrade to business class, of course) leaves me in Australia.
* 2015–2016: **Melbourne**, the most livable city in the world at the time [^1], is my home.
* 2016: Back to Europe it is, where I travel through **Scandinavia** and **Eastern Europe** for three months before settling down in London.
* 2017: **London** was good, but not great. It is time to set down some roots, and for software engineers, the place to be is the United States.

Since 2017, I have been living in **New York City**, working for a video platform company called [JW Player][2].

## The purpose of this blog
The purpose of this blog is two-fold. Most importantly, it is my outlet to **share what I stumble upon in daily life**. Think how to book luxury travel for cheap, what VPN I use, to what recreational soccer league to pick in New York.

Second, this blog is my portfolio, **my online presence as a software engineer**. Expect posts to range from how I set-up this blog, to actual coding problems, to topics such as stock options or choosing between your companies PPO or HDHP health care plans.

While I write on a large variety of topics, I by no means have a degree or certificate in any matter (except Computer Science, I know a bit about that), so take everything with a grain of salt.

> I might not know everything, but I do have an opinion about it.

At the end of the day, if my blog helps you, inspires you, or excites you, my work is done.
